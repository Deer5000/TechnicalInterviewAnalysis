"""
COMMUNICATION STEPS:

1. Restate the problem
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. State your assumptions
4. Think out loud
    1. Brainstorm solutions
    2. Explain your rationale
    3. Discuss tradeoffs
    4. Suggest improvements



ANALYSIS:
1. Restate problem

- The interviewee did a great job of restating the problem.
- He gave test inputs and got full clarity after restating the problem.
- He wrote the interview question as a comment so that he could refer back to it if needed

2. Ask clarifying problems

- Asked " Can I assume the list will always have a valid answer?"
- wrote the question as a comment as well as the interviewers response so that he could refer back to it if needed.
- the interviewee could've asked a few more clarifying questions.

3. State Assumptions

    - Stated assumptions to interviewer to make sure he was on track and understood the problem.
4. Think Out loud
    1.Brainstorm solutions
        - flowed smoothly between stating his assumptions and giving possible solutions.
        - Walked through a few solutions and picked one that 
        - gave more then one solutions and gave the time complexity of both.
        - was able to choose the solution with the quickest time complexity.

    2. Explain your rationale
        - walked through each solution
        - asked the interviewer if he wanted it optimized for time or space.
        - was able to calculate the time complexity of both.
        - chose the solution with the quickest time complexity

    3. Discuss tradeoffs

        - discussed tradeoofs between multiple solutions.
        - asked a few more clarifying questions.
        - chose the solution that was the absolute best for the problem.

    4. Suggest improvements

        - Walked the interviewer through his code.
        - Asked if the interviewer had any questions and and answered them.
        - suggested ways in which the code could be improved and asked if the interviewer if he wanted him to improve his work.
