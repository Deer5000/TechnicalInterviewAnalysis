""" INTERVIEW #2 (Matching Pairs) """


"""
COMMUNICATION STEPS:

1. Restate the problem
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. State your assumptions
4. Think out loud
    1. Brainstorm solutions
    2. Explain your rationale
    3. Discuss tradeoffs
    4. Suggest improvements



ANALYSIS:

1. Restate The Problem:

    - The interviewee restated the problem clearly.
    - Rewrote the question as a comment so that he can refer back to it if needed.

2. Ask Clarifying Questions:

    - Asked "Can I assume the list will always have a valid answer?"


3. State Your Assumptions:

    - Theres no duplicated in the list.
    - The list will not always have a valid answer.

4. Think Out Loud:

    1. Brainstorm:

        - Walked through the naive answer with the interviewer
        - Gave a more complex solution with a bettter time complexity
        - Each solution that the interviewee brainstormed was well thought out.
        - He was able to explain each solution he proposed clearly and thoroughly.
   
    2. Explain Your Rationale:

        - Gave the time complexity of the solution he created
        - walked through the solution.
        - described the space-time complexity of each solution
        - used a hashtable
        - clarified what he was optimizing for

    3. Discuss tradeoffs:
        
        - discussed tradeoffs between each solution
        - asked if the interviewer wanted to optimize for time or space.

    4. Suggest Improvements:
        
        - Asked if the interviewee wanted more than one valid answer.
        - restated assumptions
        - rewrote the solution and improved it.
